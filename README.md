Project 1 Submission - August 2022

## **Team Members**
- Kevin Olsen
- Arandi Maurine
- Kyle Jensen
- Patrick Thomas

## **Motivation**


- Our group wanted to answer the question, "Where should we register a startup?'  We set out looking for data sets that would give this answer. We looked at the factors that any new businees would consider before registereing in a particular state. 

## **Research Questions**
- The ultimate question asked was: ‘Where should I register my new startup?’
- From this main question arose another question which determined the data collected for this project: ‘What factors will a startup be concerned with when trying to register their business?’

## **Objectives**
- Collect data that will assist in anwering our question upon analysis
- Analyze and understand data via organization and visualization


## **Action Items**
- Data Cleaning
  - Data cleaning and any additional cleaning and shaping conducted by our team
  - Is there further noise/info we want to weed out? 
- Data Analysis
  - The analysis was done by ranking the factors represented in the datasets collected 
- Data Visualization 
  - Visualize a heatmap of the 10 highest ranked States
  - Visualize by Highest Ranked States
  - Visualize by Lowest Ranked States
  - Visualize different ML model outcomes?
